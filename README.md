# Stand Up

This menubar app **forces** (really! force!) you to stand up in every 40 minutes.

**But I already have an Apple Watch**, you can put off the notification sent by your watch, that never works as expected.

**But I use [stand](https://getstandapp.com/)**, I do! But same problem as above, I always ignore those notifications and keep sitting on my chair.

**Use Stand-Up!**, You will be impressed by the way it forces you to stand up.

It works fine now, but we still need to improve its UI ðŸ˜…

As soon as it has a stable and elegant UI we will distribute the `dmg` and `exe` version for you to download. Currently, you can download the [prebuilt version](http://7d9o3i.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/standup/latest.zip).
